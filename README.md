Simple Cafe Billing System 
This repository contains a basic Cafe Billing System implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface.

Features:
Graphical Interface: The application offers a user-friendly graphical interface to manage cafe orders and calculate bills.
Order Generation: Each order is assigned a unique random order number.
Item Entry: Users can input quantities for various cafe items such as French Fries, Lunch, Burger, Pizza, Cheese Burger, and Drinks.
Cost Calculation: The system calculates the cost of each item based on predefined prices and entered quantities.
Tax and Service Charge: A fixed tax rate and service charge are applied to compute the final bill.
Price List Display: The "PRICE" button displays the price list for different cafe items.
Total Calculation: Clicking the "TOTAL" button calculates the total bill, including tax and service charge.
Reset and Exit: Users can reset the form using the "RESET" button or exit the application using the "EXIT" button.

Implementation:
The primary functionality is implemented in the cafe_billing_system.py script.
Tkinter is used to create the graphical user interface with frames, labels, entry fields, and buttons.
The script starts by defining the main window dimensions and title.
Various user inputs and calculated values are managed using StringVar() variables.
The user interface allows inputting quantities for different cafe items, displays calculated costs, and provides buttons for calculations and actions.
The application supports generating random order numbers, calculating costs, taxes, and service charges, as well as resetting the form and displaying a price list.

Usage:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the cafe_billing_system.py script using a Python interpreter.
Utilize the graphical interface to input item quantities and calculate bills.
Click the "PRICE" button to view the cost of individual cafe items.

Future Enhancements:
This Simple Cafe Billing System can serve as a foundation for more advanced features:

Database Integration: Implement database functionality to store and manage orders.
User Authentication: Enhance security by adding user authentication for access.
Enhanced UI/UX: Improve the visual design and user experience of the application.
Online Ordering: Extend the system to support online orders and payments.
Contributions are welcomed to enhance the functionality and usability of this system.
